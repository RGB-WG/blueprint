# Introduction

This book targets all RGB developers and people who want to understand (and verify!) how RGB smart contracts work and how to integrate them into other software. Unlike other RGB papers, books and guidelines it tries to explain all depths of RGB without simplification - but not with a formal language, using terms and concepts which should be easy to grasp for any non-system programmer, which do not necessary has a computer science background.
